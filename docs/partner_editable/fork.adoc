While the Cloud9 IDE is being created, you can go ahead and create a _fork_ of the workshop's GitHub repository in your own account. A fork is just an exact replica of the *aws-quickstart/qs-workshop-2021* GitHub repository that resides in your GitHub account.

1. Log into GitHub
2. Navigate to https://github.com/aws-quickstart/qs-workshop-2021[the aws-quickstart/qs-workshop-2021 repository]
3. Click *Fork* in the top-right corner

That's it! A copy of the repository should now be hosted in your GitHub account.
