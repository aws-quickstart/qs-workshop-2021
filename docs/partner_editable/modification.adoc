Now that you've verified that your forked code works as intended, you can modify the code to fit your use case. The Quick Start contains two templates: a _main_ template and a _workload_ template. The _main_ template is a parent template, it deploys other templates in sequence: VPC, workload, and Remote Desktop Gateway or Linux Bastion. The _workload_ template deploys the actual Quick Start workload: the auto-scaling web server group and the load balancer. AWS customers and Partners can make whatever changes they want to either of these templates to suit their own use cases.

1. From the folder view, double-click on the file *templates/workshop.template.yaml*

2. You should now be able to view and modify the template. Here we'll go over the different template sections.

* The first line is *AWSTemplateFormatVersion*. As of right now all CloudFormation templates have the value '2010-09-09'.
* The second section is the description, which is simply a textual description of what the template does.
* Next we have the template *Metadata*.
** The first bit of metadata is the CloudFormation interface. This describes how the CloudForamtion console will look to the end customer when the template is launched.
*** *ParameterGroups* describe how the parameters should be grouped in the CloudFormation console.
*** *ParameterLabels* apply descriptive labels to the parameters in the CloudFormation console.
* Next is the *Parameters* section. All of the parameters used to launch the template are here, along with parameter descriptions, restrictions, types, and default values where applicable.
* *Rules* ensure the template has parameter values that won't cause it to fail.
* *Mappings* ensure Region-specific Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) are used for the EC2 instances.
* *Conditions* are statements that are true if they meet certain conditions. In this case, the condition _UsingDefaultBucket_ is true if the _QSS3BucketName_ parameter value is "aws-quickstart".
* *Resources* are the actual assets deployed to a customer account. Resources deployed by this tempalte include a Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic, EC2 security groups, an elastic load balancer, IAM roles, an auto-scaling group launch configuration, an auto-scaling group, CloudWatch alarms, and an S3 bucket.
* *Outputs* are presented to the customer after the template has completed deploying, such as the fully-qualified domain name used to access a web application.

3. Make a change to the template. For a very basic example, imagine a published Quick Start only supports T2 EC2 instances, but a customer wants to deploy a T3 EC2 instance. In this case, we could add *_t3.large_* to the list of allowed values for the instnace type parameter. In the case of this workshop, we can add *_t3.large_* at line 130 of the workload template.
4. Save the updated template.
5. To ensure the modified template builds successfully, we can run *_taskcat test run -l_* from the root of the repository in our IDE.
