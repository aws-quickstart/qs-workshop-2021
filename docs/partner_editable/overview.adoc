https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart[AWS Quick Starts] Quick Starts are built by Amazon Web Services (AWS) solutions architects and Partners to help you deploy popular technologies on AWS, based on AWS best practices for security and high availability. These accelerators reduce hundreds of manual procedures into just a few steps, so you can build your production environment quickly and start using it immediately.

Each Quick Start includes AWS CloudFormation templates that automate the deployment and a guide that discusses the architecture and provides step-by-step deployment instructions.

Each published Quick Start is open source, with the source code residing in a public GitHub repository under the https://github.com/aws-quickstart[aws-quickstart GitHub organization]. While Quick Starts are designed to fit most common use cases for the product(s) and/or service(s) being deployed, customers with unique use cases often need to modify the underlying CloudFormation templates, Lambda functions, scripts, or other aspects of a Quick Start, which is enabled by the open source nature of the Quick Start code. You can create a copy of any published Quick Start in your own GitHub account, make whatever changes to it you need, utilize our automated testing tool to test your changes, and deploy your updated content from your own S3 bucket.
