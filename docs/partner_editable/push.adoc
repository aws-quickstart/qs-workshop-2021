Now that we have modified the Quick Start template in our local IDE, we need to push that change back to our forked repository in our GitHub account.

1. From the root of the repository in your IDE, add a _commit_ message that describes the change that was made. If support for T3 EC2 instances was added as in the example above, run the command *_git commit -a -m "Automating HTTPS installation and updating AMIs"_*
2. Run *_git push_* to _push_ the changes up to the GitHub repository.
